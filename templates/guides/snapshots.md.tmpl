# Create Consul cluster snapshots

The snapshot resource allows users to manage Consul snapshots of an HCS cluster. Snapshots currently have a retention policy of 30 days.

Restoring snapshots via Terraform is not supported.  If you would like to restore a snapshot for your Consul cluster, navigate to the snapshots page via the HCP UI.

This can be found at the `/snapshots` path for your cluster.  For example if the URL to your cluster is:

`https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/resources/consul/consul-cluster?project_id=<project_id>`

Then you would navigate to:

`https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/resources/consul/consul-cluster/snapshots?project_id=<project_id>`
